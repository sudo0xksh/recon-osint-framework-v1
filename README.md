# recon-osint-framework-v1
A Python-based framework that automates web reconnaissance and OSINT by chaining crawling, vulnerability scanners, Nmap, and Shodan into a single workflow.  Built to understand how recon and OSINT fit together, not to replace enterprise tools.  Structured, modular, and learning-focused.
